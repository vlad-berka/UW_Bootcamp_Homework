        <h2><u>BIO</u></h2>
        <p>
            After graduating from Western Washington University, friends Harrison Mills & Clayton Knight decided to merge<!br>
            into the DJ duo known as <em>ODESZA</em>. They've kickstarted their musical stardom in 2012 with the iconic album <em>Summer's Gone</em><!br>
            and followed it with <em>In Return</em> in 2014 to critical acclaim. Their growing success has gained them their first Grammy nomination<!br>
            for <em>Say My Name</em> in 2016, a second nomination for <em>A Moment Apart</em> in 2017, and a third nomination for <em>Line of Sight</em> in 2018.<!br>
        </p>
        <p> After having strongly toured their "A Moment Apart" album for almost two years, the duo are laying low in Bellingham, WA while releasing <!br>
            music sproradically - much to the chagrin of many fans. They are currently actively collaborating with <em>Golden Features</em> under the <!br>
            name <strong>BRONSON</strong>, but have yet to release a new album themselves. I guess we just have to wait patiently and see!
